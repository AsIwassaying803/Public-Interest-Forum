Nigeria’s Begging Economy Signals a Deeper Governance Failure

An informal welfare system replaces the state
Nigeria is developing an informal survival system that deserves closer scrutiny: a growing culture of begging within families and social networks. This is not a moral critique of individuals, but an economic signal. The country is drifting into what can be described as a begging economy—an unmeasured but increasingly central mechanism for coping with poverty and institutional failure.
World Bank estimates suggest that more than half of Nigeria’s population lives below the poverty line, with rural poverty far exceeding urban levels. Although inflation has shown periods of moderation, prolonged high food and transport prices have already weakened household resilience and eroded savings.
Employment without security
Labour market conditions compound the problem. Official unemployment figures obscure widespread underemployment and informal work. Many Nigerians are employed but remain unable to meet basic needs, reflecting the growth of working poverty rather than joblessness alone.
In this environment, begging has become a functional coping strategy. Informally raised funds support rent payments, school fees, healthcare, funerals, weddings, and small enterprises. What social welfare systems provide in more functional states has been outsourced to personal networks.
Digital tools accelerate dependence
The reach of this culture is notable. Begging now extends beyond immediate family to religious institutions, schools, workplaces, social clubs, and community groups. Contributions are framed as voluntary, yet social pressure often makes refusal difficult.
Smartphones and bank accounts have accelerated the process. Messaging platforms allow instant appeals, while digital transfers make giving effortless. WhatsApp fundraising groups and repeated direct requests—popularly termed “urgent 2k”—have become routine.
When social capital substitutes for policy
This phenomenon points to a deeper structural problem. In economies with functioning institutions, citizens rely on welfare systems, pensions, insurance, and credit markets to absorb shocks. In Nigeria, the weakness of these mechanisms has forced households to substitute the state with private coping arrangements.
The costs are accumulating. Family networks are overstretched, savings are depleted, and trust is strained. Retirement increasingly leads to poverty as delayed pensions and unpaid gratuities leave older citizens dependent on relatives.
A policy failure, not a cultural one
Nigeria cannot sustainably rely on social capital to compensate for institutional failure. The expansion of the begging economy is not cultural adaptation; it is a policy outcome. Reversing it requires credible job creation, functional social protection, reliable pension systems, and reforms that raise incomes rather than merely manage inflation. Without such reforms, begging will remain a defining feature of Nigeria’s political economy—and a stark measure of governance failure.
